# Converts a number to a Roman numeral

This app converts a number to a Roman numeral using Laravel for the backend and React for the frontend.

To get started, open your terminal program and cd to the directory and run the following commands:

```php
//Install necessary php packages
composer install

//Install necessary npm packages
npm install
